subtitle: World-class science and technology research and teaching for media and the arts
body: |
  qMedia’s mission is to be the UK’s leading research centre in digital technologies for media and arts. The qMedia research groups form a multi-disciplinary team for solving digital media problems. We work in partnership with other world class organisations and institutions in the UK and further afield, with a focus on disseminating knowledge to the wider community.
  Teaching is also a qMedia priority, driven by the EPSRC Doctoral Training Centre in Media and Arts Technology. Programmes of study include a unique 4-year PhD programme built around a combination of coursework and research, a 1-year Master’s by Research in Media and Arts Technology, and new for 2012, a B.Sc. programme in Media and Arts Technology.
